# synthetic-realness

Synthetic Realness is the experience of environments that feel emotionally or
socially real while being structurally optimized, simulated, or incentive-driven
rather than organically human.

The term describes a condition where surface authenticity is preserved, but
underlying meaning, continuity, or human grounding is degraded by design.
